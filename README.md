Right now, Creative Commons work is spread wide across the web - and we wouldn't have it any other way!
But sometimes you want a single point of entry to it all.
This app aggregates CC music from all around the web, some of which aren't even on the [Creative Commons search engine](http://search.creativecommons.org/),
such as Newgrounds. By doing this, it really puts back the "Commons" in "Creative Commons".
